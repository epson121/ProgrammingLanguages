# Programming Languages


### About the course: 

This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a 
strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, 
and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough 
about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any 
language -- and in learning new ones.

This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- 
it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs 
effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different 
languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax 
of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how 
to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most 
important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. 
Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun 
building it.
